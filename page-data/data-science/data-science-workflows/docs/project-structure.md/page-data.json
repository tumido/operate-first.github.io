That said, I don’t want that to be misinterpreted to mean that what is outlined below are mere suggestions. Between updates of this document, we should try and follow its outline as close as possible to ensure consistency across projects and to learn together what is and is not working. <em>Please track all suggestions as comments in this document. : )</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"general-info-about-project-needs-and-structure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#general-info-about-project-needs-and-structure\" aria-label=\"general info about project needs and structure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>General Info about project needs and structure:</h3>\n<ol class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>All Data Scientists will request and receive a default Jupyterhub instance of 32gb Ram and larger pvc from the DH team.
