Because of this, scaling storage up can be resource-intensive. This project seeks to mitigate this issue using machine learning. The primary goal here is to build a model to predict if a hard drive will fail within a predefined future time interval. These predictions can then be used by Ceph (or other similar systems) to create or destroy replicas accordingly. In addition to making storage more resource-efficient, this may also improve fault tolerance by up to an order of magnitude, since the probability of data loss is generally related to the probability of multiple, concurrent device failures.\"), mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, \"Github Repo : \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/ceph_drive_failure\"\n  }), \"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/ceph_drive_failure\"))), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Data Science Workflows\"), \" : AI Ops team has been working on developing a more structured process around how we manage, execute and deliver on our data science projects, especially those where we collaborate with other Red Hat teams.

The data comprises hardware and software description, configurations, and logs of the systems. In this project, the focus is on analysis of configuration files.

Since there are a variety of reasons why an OpenShift cluster might fail, finding and fixing the issue that the cluster suffers from is not always trivial. However, if we can predict in advance whether a cluster will run into a given issue, then we may be able to fix it before it fails or before it severely impacts the customer. Issues in a cluster are often defined by, or closely related to, the alerts that it fires. So predicting alerts can be a step towards predicting the underlying issue.
